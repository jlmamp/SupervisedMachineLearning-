#  Predicting Credit Risk

 A machine learning model that attempts to predict whether a loan will be approved or not.
I used this data to create machine learning models to classify the risk level of given loans. Specifically, to compare the Logistic Regression model and Random Forest Classifier.
Retrieved the data imported the data using Pandas.
Also Created and compared two models on this data: a logistic regression, and a random forests classifier. Before you create, fit, and score the models, make a prediction as to which model you think will perform better.
Created a LogisticRegression model, that connect to the data, and printed the model's score.
